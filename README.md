# Chocolate Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This portfolio project focuses on analyzing chocolate-related data using SQL and Power BI. The project includes:
- **A dataset** (`choclate protfolio project - 11.csv`)
- **Power BI report** (`Chocolate.pbix`)
- **SQL queries** (`SQL Chocolate.sql`)

## Files Included
- **`choclate protfolio project - 11.csv`**: Contains raw data related to chocolates, including sales, ratings, and other relevant metrics.
- **`Chocolate.pbix`**: A Power BI dashboard visualizing key insights from the dataset.
- **`SQL Chocolate.sql`**: SQL queries used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

## How to Use
### 1. SQL Analysis
- Open `SQL Chocolate.sql` in a SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).
- Execute the queries to explore and analyze the dataset.

### 2. Power BI Dashboard
- Open `Chocolate.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
- Refresh the data connection if needed.
- Explore visualizations and insights related to chocolate sales, trends, and other key metrics.

### 3. Data Exploration
- Load `choclate protfolio project - 11.csv` into a tool like Excel, Python (Pandas), or SQL for additional exploration.

## Key Insights (Optional, Based on Analysis)
- Top-performing chocolates based on ratings.
- Sales trends over time.
- Market share distribution among different brands.

## Prerequisites
- Power BI Desktop (for `.pbix` file)
- SQL Database (for running queries)
- Excel or Python (for working with the CSV file)

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the dataset with additional features.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Automate data updates using ETL pipelines.
